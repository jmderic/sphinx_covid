Methodology
===========

The goal here (a.k.a., roadmap) was and is to create a static website
that automatically updates itself when a new day of virus data is
released.  In specific, this is not designed to be a dynamic site
wherein the user requests tables and plots.

A second, important goal is to provide sufficient disclosure to allow
peer review of the data and methods used for website generation.

Currently, the goals are only partially met.  The discussion of the
components to accomplish the goals will be expanded as we get closer
to achieving the goals.
