Methodology
===========

This is the beginning skeleton.

Data Source
^^^^^^^^^^^

The data is sourced from the John's Hopkins github repository, ::

    git@github.com:CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.git

from the time series file
``csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series``.  This file contains
data, by county, in csv format with a column for each date since the
beginning of the epidemic.

Data Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The data is aggregated from many sources and the details of the
specific data items may vary from jurisdiction to another.

Graph Types
^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three graphs for each location.
